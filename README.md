With the help of the innovative mobile app Ziraatech-dashboard, which was created with Flutter and Firebase, users can easily manage their plants from a distance. Easy account creation allows users to keep an eye on important plant parameters like temperature, humidity, ground humidity, and luminosity from anywhere. Furthermore, the app makes it simple to integrate trackers by ID, which simplifies plant monitoring. The application, which makes use of cutting-edge artificial intelligence, has a special feature that lets users identify and detect different kinds of insects using the camera on their phone. This completes the precision agriculture solution.
